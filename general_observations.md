## General observations 
* As one cold intuitively expect, there is a positive correlation between the number of customers and sales.
    * There are stores that usually receive a much larger number of customers and therefore generate a much higher volume of sales than the average. This is most likely due to their location.
    * One of the goals of commercial strategies should therefore be to optimize the relationship between the number of customers and the volume of sales generated. Ideally, every visitor to a store should become an effective buyer with a relative high expenditure.
    * Another reasonable goal is to increase the number of visitors as much as possible according to the location of the store.
    * In the exploratory data analysis (EDA), we could observe that there are more customers and more sales when a promotion is active (variable Promo in the sales database).
* Some other observations:
    * Stores that are open on Sundays generate high profits, but the ratio of customers to sales is not as high.
    * During the holidays there are generally more customers and sales, especially during Easter vacations and Christmas.
