# Data Science Project for Rossmann
Rossmann operates over 4,300 drugstores in 9 European countries (see https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rossmann_(retail chain)). Currently, Rossmann store managers are tasked with preparing their weekly sales forecasts up to eight weeks in advance. Store sales results are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competitive intensity, school and national vacations, seasonal changes and location conditions. Because thousands of individual store managers create sales forecasts based on their individual circumstances, the accuracy of the results can vary widely. Therefore, the company's data science team is on a new mission to create a unified modeling methodology for store managers to predict weekly results with greater accuracy. The management team also needs an overall report with feasible or actionable strategies to understand the overall performance of all stores and find a way to optimize future sales performance (i.e. revenue). Finally, an individual store performance report needs to be provided to each store manager.
